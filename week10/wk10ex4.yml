# 4. Create an Ansible module that takes one argument named "my_string".
# This argument is a string and is required.
# The module should take the string and convert it to upper case and should return it the "output" field of the results.

# Construct an Ansible playbook that uses this new module and verify that the module operates properly.
# Inspect the output using "-vvv".
# Ensure you see the "output" field and ensure that your original string has been converted to upper case.
