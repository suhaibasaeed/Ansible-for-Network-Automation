# 1e. Create a YAML file that is a nested data structure.
# The highest level data structure is dictionary with key "network_devices".
# The value corresponding to this key should be a two-element list.
# Each element of this list should contain a dictionary with six key-value pairs
# (host, username, password, device_type, use_session_log, ip_addresses).
# The ip_addresses key should point to list of IPs that each device has
# (just make up three IP addresses for each device).
