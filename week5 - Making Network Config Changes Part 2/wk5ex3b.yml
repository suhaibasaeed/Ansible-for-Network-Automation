# 3b. Re-order your access-list such that one of the last three access-list lines is now at the beginning.
# Additionally convert this moved ACL entry from being a "permit" statement to being a "deny" statement.
# Ensure that executing your new playbook results in the correct final access-list being configured.

# Once again use the "ios_command" module and the "debug" module
# To verify that your updated ACL is properly configured.
# Your playbook should be idempotent.
