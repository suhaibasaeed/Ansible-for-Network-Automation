# 2. Use napalm_get_facts and the "get_lldp_neighbors()" method (filter: lldp_neighbors)
# to retrieve the LLDP neighbors from all of the Arista and Cisco IOS/IOS-XE devices.

# Reformat the retrieved data to print out the following table to standard output (in a somewhat readable way).
# Note, you might need to use the "stdout_callback = debug" to accomplish this (i.e. to make the output somewhat readable):
# ********* LLDP table for (cisco6) ********
# GigabitEthernet2: cisco5
# GigabitEthernet3: cisco5
# GigabitEthernet4: cisco5
# GigabitEthernet5: cisco5
# GigabitEthernet6: cisco5
# GigabitEthernet7: cisco5

# >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
# The first entry should be the local interface and the second entry should be the remote peer that is visible via that interface.
# You should clearly indicate which device the LLDP data was retrieved from.

# You can loop through the data and use string concatenation to generate one large string (per device).
# You will subsequently output this string to the screen.
